# ðŸ”—

ðŸ”— (Link) is a Declarative data binding pattern for HTML

The goal of this syntax is to offer a simple way to output HTML that is usable and meaningful from the start, and easy to keep bound to the state of an application once in the browser.

## Attribute Conventions

ðŸ”— is built on standard HTML data attributes. These attributes are designed to reference relationships between HTML elements and JavaScript variables, arrays, objects, and properties for one-way data binding. In other words, when a variable changes, any markup linked to that should reflect that.
